### Object detection using Faster RCNN with YOLOv5 

# ðŸš€ Faster R-CNN
Tt uses CNN network to extract feature map. However, instead of using selective search to identify region proposals, Faster R-CNN uses Region proposal network (RPN) to predict region proposals. These predicted region proposals are reshaped using the RoI pooling layer and used to classify and determine the offsets of bounding boxes.

## ðŸ”– About respository
YOLOv5 works by using a neural network shutter to classify pixels in an image into different objects. 
The neural network is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, where each image is labeled with objects in the image.
YOLOv5 has several benefits over other objects detected by other methods. It's faster, more efficient and has more precision. YOLOv5 is also capable of detecting multiple objects in the same image.
